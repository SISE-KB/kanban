 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the `myModule.animation()` function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, by default, if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated
 * until the parent element's animation has completed. This blocking feature can be overridden by
 * placing the `ng-animate-children` attribute on a parent container tag.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="slide-animation" ng-if="on" ng-animate-children>
 *   <div class="fade-animation" ng-if="on">
 *     <div class="explode-animation" ng-if="on">
 *        ...
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `on` expression value changes and an animation is triggered then each of the elements within
 * will all animate without the block being applied to child elements.
 *
 * ## Are animations run when the application starts?
 * No they are not. When an application is bootstrapped Angular will disable animations from running to avoid
 * a frenzy of animations from being triggered as soon as the browser has rendered the screen. For this to work,
 * Angular will wait for two digest cycles until enabling animations. From there on, any animation-triggering
 * layout changes in the application will trigger animations as normal.
 *
 * In addition, upon bootstrap, if the routing system or any directives or load remote data (via $http) then Angular
 * will automatically extend the wait time to enable animations once **all** of the outbound HTTP requests
 * are complete.
 *
 * ## CSS-defined Animations
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * ### Structural transition animations
 *
 * Structural transitions (such as enter, leave and move) will always apply a `0s none` transition
 * value to force the browser into rendering the styles defined in the setup (`.ng-enter`, `.ng-leave`
 * or `.ng-move`) class. This means that any active transition animations operating on the element
 * will be cut off to make way for the enter, leave or move animation.
 *
 * ### Class-based transition animations
 *
 * Class-based transitions refer to transition animations that are triggered when a CSS class is
 * added to or removed from the element (via `$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass`,
 * `$animate.setClass`, or by directives such as `ngClass`, `ngModel` and `form`).
 * They are different when compared to structural animations since they **do not cancel existing
 * animations** nor do they **block successive transitions** from rendering on the same element.
 * This distinction allows for **multiple class-based transitions** to be performed on the same element.
 *
 * In addition to ngAnimate supporting the default (natural) functionality of class-based transition
 * animations, ngAnimate also decorates the element with starting and ending CSS classes to aid the
 * developer in further styling the element throughout the transition animation. Earlier versions
 * of ngAnimate may have caused natural CSS transitions to break and not render properly due to
 * $animate temporarily blocking transitions using `0s none` in order to allow the setup CSS class
 * (the `-add` or `-remove` class) to be applied without triggering an animation. However, as of
 * **version 1.3**, this workaround has been removed with ngAnimate and all non-ngAnimate CSS
 * class transitions are compatible with ngAnimate.
 *
 * There is, however, one special case when dealing with class-based transitions in ngAnimate.
 * When rendering class-based transitions that make use of the setup and active CSS classes
 * (e.g. `.fade-add` and `.fade-add-active` for when `.fade` is added) be sure to define
 * the transition value **on the active CSS class** and not the setup class.
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade-add {
 *   /&#42; remember to place a 0s transition here
 *      to ensure that the styles are applied instantly
 *      even if the element already has a transition style &#42;/
 *   transition:0s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; starting CSS styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade-add.fade-add-active {
 *   /&#42; this will be the length of the animation &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The setup CSS class (in this case `.fade-add`) also has a transition style property, however, it
 * has a duration of zero. This may not be required, however, incase the browser is unable to render
 * the styling present in this CSS class instantly then it could be that the browser is attempting
 * to perform an unnecessary transition.
 *
 * This workaround, however, does not apply to  standard class-based transitions that are rendered
 * when a CSS class containing a transition is applied to an element:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; this works as expected &#42;/
 * .fade {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please keep this in mind when coding the CSS markup that will be used within class-based transitions.
 * Also, try not to mix the two class-based animation flavors together since the CSS code may become
 * overly complex.
 *
 *
 * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries
 *
 * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
 * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
 * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.
 *
 * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/
 * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:
 *
 * ```js
 * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
 * ```
 * </div>
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ## JavaScript-defined Animations
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * ```js
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).
 *
 *
 * ### Applying Directive-specific Styles to an Animation
 * In some cases a directive or service may want to provide `$animate` with extra details that the animation will
 * include into its animation. Let's say for example we wanted to render an animation that animates an element
 * towards the mouse coordinates as to where the user clicked last. By collecting the X/Y coordinates of the click
 * (via the event parameter) we can set the `top` and `left` styles into an object and pass that into our function
 * call to `$animate.addClass`.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the animation runs, and a transition or keyframe animation is picked up, then the animation itself will
 * also include and transition the styling of the `left` and `top` properties into its running animation. If we want
 * to provide some starting animation values then we can do so by placing the starting animations styles into an object
 * called `from` in the same object as the `to` animations.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     from: {
 *        position: 'absolute',
 *        left: '0px',
 *        top: '0px'
 *     },
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Once the animation is complete or cancelled then the union of both the before and after styles are applied to the
 * element. If `ngAnimate` is not present then the styles will be applied immediately.

      /**
       * @ngdoc service
       * @name $animate
       * @kind object
       *
       * @description
       * The `$animate` service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
       * When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
       * will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
       * as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.
       *
       * The `$animate` service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
       * will work out of the box without any extra configuration.
       *
       * Requires the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module to be installed.
       *
       * Please visit the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.
       * ## Callback Promises
       * With AngularJS 1.3, each of the animation methods, on the `$animate` service, return a promise when called. The
       * promise itself is then resolved once the animation has completed itself, has been cancelled or has been
       * skipped due to animations being disabled. (Note that even if the animation is cancelled it will still
       * call the resolve function of the animation.)
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.enter(element, container).then(function() {
       *   //...this is called once the animation is complete...
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * Also note that, due to the nature of the callback promise, if any Angular-specific code (like changing the scope,
       * location of the page, etc...) is executed within the callback promise then be sure to wrap the code using
       * `$scope.$apply(...)`;
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.leave(element).then(function() {
       *   $scope.$apply(function() {
       *     $location.path('/new-page');
       *   });
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * An animation can also be cancelled by calling the `$animate.cancel(promise)` method with the provided
       * promise that was returned when the animation was started.
       *
       * ```js
       * var promise = $animate.addClass(element, 'super-long-animation');
       * promise.then(function() {
       *   //this will still be called even if cancelled
       * });
       *
       * element.on('click', function() {
       *   //tooo lazy to wait for the animation to end
       *   $animate.cancel(promise);
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * (Keep in mind that the promise cancellation is unique to `$animate` since promises in
       * general cannot be cancelled.)
       *

         * |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
         * | 1. `$animate.animate(...)` is called                                                                                  | `class="my-animation"`                                       |
         * | 2. `$animate` waits for the next digest to start the animation                                                        | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 3. `$animate` runs the JavaScript-defined animations detected on the element                                          | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 4. the `className` class value is added to the element                                                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 5. `$animate` scans the element styles to get the CSS transition/animation duration and delay                         | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 6. `$animate` blocks all CSS transitions on the element to ensure the `.className` class styling is applied right away| `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 7. `$animate` applies the provided collection of `from` CSS styles to the element                                     | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 8. `$animate` waits for a single animation frame (this performs a reflow)                                             | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 9. `$animate` removes the CSS transition block placed on the element                                                  | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 10. the `className-active` class is added (this triggers the CSS transition/animation)                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 11. `$animate` applies the collection of `to` CSS styles to the element which are then handled by the transition      | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 12. `$animate` waits for the animation to complete (via events and timeout)                                           | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 13. The animation ends and all generated CSS classes are removed from the element                                     | `class="my-animation"`                                       |

         * Triggers a custom animation event based off the className variable and then removes the CSS class provided by the className value
         * from the element. Unlike the other animation methods, the animate service will suffix the className value with {@type -remove} in
         * order to provide the animate service the setup and active CSS classes in order to trigger the animation (this will be skipped if
         * no CSS transitions or keyframes are defined on the -remove or base CSS classes).
         *
         * Below is a breakdown of each step that occurs during removeClass animation:

 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAria
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAria` module provides support for common
 * [<abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
 * attributes that convey state or semantic information about the application for users
 * of assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAria"></div>
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * For ngAria to do its magic, simply include the module as a dependency. The directives supported
 * by ngAria are:
 * `ngModel`, `ngDisabled`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngClick`, `ngDblClick`, and `ngMessages`.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the attributes handled by ngAria:
 *
 * | Directive                                   | Supported Attributes                                                                   |
 * |---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngDisabled ngDisabled}  | aria-disabled                                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow ngShow}          | aria-hidden                                                                            |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngHide ngHide}          | aria-hidden                                                                            |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngDblclick ngDblclick}  | tabindex                                                                               |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages ngMessages}        | aria-live                                                                              |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel}        | aria-checked, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, aria-valuenow, aria-invalid, aria-required, input roles |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick}        | tabindex, keypress event, button role                                                               |
 *
 * Find out more information about each directive by reading the
 * {@link guide/accessibility ngAria Developer Guide}.
 *
 * ##Example
 * Using ngDisabled with ngAria:
 * ```html
 * <md-checkbox ng-disabled="disabled">
 * ```
 * Becomes:
 * ```html
 * <md-checkbox ng-disabled="disabled" aria-disabled="true">
 * ```
 *
 * ##Disabling Attributes
 * It's possible to disable individual attributes added by ngAria with the
 * {@link ngAria.$ariaProvider#config config} method. For more details, see the
 * {@link guide/accessibility Developer Guide}.

   *
   * @description
   * @priority 200
   *
   * The $aria service contains helper methods for applying common
   * [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) attributes to HTML directives.
   *
   * ngAria injects common accessibility attributes that tell assistive technologies when HTML
   * elements are enabled, selected, hidden, and more. To see how this is performed with ngAria,
   * let's review a code snippet from ngAria itself:
   *
   *```js
   * ngAriaModule.directive('ngDisabled', ['$aria', function($aria) {
   *   return $aria.$$watchExpr('ngDisabled', 'aria-disabled');
   * }])
   *```
   * Shown above, the ngAria module creates a directive with the same signature as the
   * traditional `ng-disabled` directive. But this ngAria version is dedicated to
   * solely managing accessibility attributes. The internal `$aria` service is used to watch the
   * boolean attribute `ngDisabled`. If it has not been explicitly set by the developer,
   * `aria-disabled` is injected as an attribute with its value synchronized to the value in
   * `ngDisabled`.
   *
   * Because ngAria hooks into the `ng-disabled` directive, developers do not have to do
   * anything to enable this feature. The `aria-disabled` attribute is automatically managed
   * simply as a silent side-effect of using `ng-disabled` with the ngAria module.
   *
   * The full list of directives that interface with ngAria:
   * * **ngModel**
   * * **ngShow**
   * * **ngHide**
   * * **ngClick**
   * * **ngDblclick**
   * * **ngMessages**
   * * **ngDisabled**
   *
   * Read the {@link guide/accessibility ngAria Developer Guide} for a thorough explanation of each
   * directive.
   *
   *
   * ## Dependencies
   * Requires the {@link ngAria} module to be installed.

/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngMessages
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngMessages` module provides enhanced support for displaying messages within templates
 * (typically within forms or when rendering message objects that return key/value data).
 * Instead of relying on JavaScript code and/or complex ng-if statements within your form template to
 * show and hide error messages specific to the state of an input field, the `ngMessages` and
 * `ngMessage` directives are designed to handle the complexity, inheritance and priority
 * sequencing based on the order of how the messages are defined in the template.
 *
 * Currently, the ngMessages module only contains the code for the `ngMessages`
 * and `ngMessage` directives.
 *
 * # Usage
 * The `ngMessages` directive listens on a key/value collection which is set on the ngMessages attribute.
 * Since the {@link ngModel ngModel} directive exposes an `$error` object, this error object can be
 * used with `ngMessages` to display control error messages in an easier way than with just regular angular
 * template directives.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form name="myForm">
 *   <input type="text" ng-model="field" name="myField" required minlength="5" />
 *   <div ng-messages="myForm.myField.$error">
 *     <div ng-message="required">You did not enter a field</div>
 *     <div ng-message="minlength">The value entered is too short</div>
 *   </div>
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * Now whatever key/value entries are present within the provided object (in this case `$error`) then
 * the ngMessages directive will render the inner first ngMessage directive (depending if the key values
 * match the attribute value present on each ngMessage directive). In other words, if your errors
 * object contains the following data:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <!-- keep in mind that ngModel automatically sets these error flags -->
 * myField.$error = { minlength : true, required : false };
 * ```
 *
 * Then the `required` message will be displayed first. When required is false then the `minlength` message
 * will be displayed right after (since these messages are ordered this way in the template HTML code).
 * The prioritization of each message is determined by what order they're present in the DOM.
 * Therefore, instead of having custom JavaScript code determine the priority of what errors are
 * present before others, the presentation of the errors are handled within the template.
 *
 * By default, ngMessages will only display one error at a time. However, if you wish to display all
 * messages then the `ng-messages-multiple` attribute flag can be used on the element containing the
 * ngMessages directive to make this happen.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-messages="myForm.myField.$error" ng-messages-multiple>...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Reusing and Overriding Messages
 * In addition to prioritization, ngMessages also allows for including messages from a remote or an inline
 * template. This allows for generic collection of messages to be reused across multiple parts of an
 * application.
 *
 * ```html
 * <script type="text/ng-template" id="error-messages">
 *   <div ng-message="required">This field is required</div>
 *   <div ng-message="minlength">This field is too short</div>
 * </script>
 * <div ng-messages="myForm.myField.$error" ng-messages-include="error-messages"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * However, including generic messages may not be useful enough to match all input fields, therefore,
 * `ngMessages` provides the ability to override messages defined in the remote template by redefining
 * then within the directive container.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- a generic template of error messages known as "my-custom-messages" -->
 * <script type="text/ng-template" id="my-custom-messages">
 *   <div ng-message="required">This field is required</div>
 *   <div ng-message="minlength">This field is too short</div>
 * </script>
 *
 * <form name="myForm">
 *   <input type="email"
 *          id="email"
 *          name="myEmail"
 *          ng-model="email"
 *          minlength="5"
 *          required />
 *
 *   <div ng-messages="myForm.myEmail.$error" ng-messages-include="my-custom-messages">
 *     <!-- this required message has overridden the template message -->
 *     <div ng-message="required">You did not enter your email address</div>
 *
 *     <!-- this is a brand new message and will appear last in the prioritization -->
 *     <div ng-message="email">Your email address is invalid</div>
 *   </div>
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * In the example HTML code above the message that is set on required will override the corresponding
 * required message defined within the remote template. Therefore, with particular input fields (such
 * email addresses, date fields, autocomplete inputs, etc...), specialized error messages can be applied
 * while more generic messages can be used to handle other, more general input errors.
 *
 * ## Animations
 * If the `ngAnimate` module is active within the application then both the `ngMessages` and
 * `ngMessage` directives will trigger animations whenever any messages are added and removed
 * from the DOM by the `ngMessages` directive.
 *
 * Whenever the `ngMessages` directive contains one or more visible messages then the `.ng-active` CSS
 * class will be added to the element. The `.ng-inactive` CSS class will be applied when there are no
 * animations present. Therefore, CSS transitions and keyframes as well as JavaScript animations can
 * hook into the animations whenever these classes are added/removed.
 *
 * Let's say that our HTML code for our messages container looks like so:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-messages="myMessages" class="my-messages">
 *   <div ng-message="alert" class="some-message">...</div>
 *   <div ng-message="fail" class="some-message">...</div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Then the CSS animation code for the message container looks like so:
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-messages {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 * }

    * @description
    * `ngMessages` is a directive that is designed to show and hide messages based on the state
    * of a key/value object that it listens on. The directive itself compliments error message
    * reporting with the `ngModel` $error object (which stores a key/value state of validation errors).
    *
    * `ngMessages` manages the state of internal messages within its container element. The internal
    * messages use the `ngMessage` directive and will be inserted/removed from the page depending
    * on if they're present within the key/value object. By default, only one message will be displayed
    * at a time and this depends on the prioritization of the messages within the template. (This can
    * be changed by using the ng-messages-multiple on the directive container.)
    *
    * A remote template can also be used to promote message reusability and messages can also be
    * overridden.
    *
    * {@link module:ngMessages Click here} to learn more about `ngMessages` and `ngMessage`.

 *   The input is sanitized by parsing the HTML into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are

 *   parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
 *   browser, won't make it through the sanitizer. The input may also contain SVG markup.
 *   The whitelist is configured using the functions `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and
 *   `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider `$compileProvider`}.
